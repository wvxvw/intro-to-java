* Installation

** Dependencies
  This project uses Maven to fetch its dependencies.
  Maven is usually provided by Linux systems.  Use your package
  manager to install it.  For example, on Debina-like systems
  you would run:

  #+begin_src sh
    sudo apt-get install mvn
  #+end_src

  On RHEL-like systems you would run:

  #+begin_src sh
    sudo dnf install mvn
  #+end_src

  Installation instructions for MS Windows and Apple OS can be found

  - Apple OS X :: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8826881/maven-install-on-mac-os-x

** Sources
   Run:
   #+begin_src sh
     git clone https://github.com/wvxvw/intro-to-java.git
   #+end_src

   Or download the project sources from
   https://github.com/wvxvw/intro-to-java/archive/master.zip

* Building
  Run:
  #+begin_src sh
    mvn package
  #+end_src
  to generate an executable JAR file.  The file will be generated in
  [[./target/assignments-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar]].  Be patient while Maven resolves
  its dependencies.  Repeated builds will take significantly less time.

* Using
  Run:
  #+begin_src sh
    java -jar ./target/assignments-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --help
  #+end_src
  to read the available options.

  Run: 
  #+begin_src sh
    java -jar ./target/assignments-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -a N
  #+end_src
  where =N= is the assignment number, to load N'th assignment.
